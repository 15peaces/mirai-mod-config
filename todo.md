
## Todo

- [ ] put a .gitignore in the project directory.
- [ ] finish Makefile.mingw (use ./tools/txt2lua.lua for converting the .xrc and Config.lua)
- [ ] put a dummy program into main lua to test the makefile.
- [ ] write a library for reading/writing Config.lua (original Config.lua is in ./data/Config.lua)
- [ ] build a GUI with wxFormBuilder and generate an xrc file. (place the xrc file inside ./data/)
- [ ] write readme.md

##Notes

- the original Config.lua is in ./data/Config.lua. it will be placed as a string inside the config program
so that it can restore the original settings.
